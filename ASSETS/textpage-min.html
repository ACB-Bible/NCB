Some of these goals are a Bible website for Bible study and also for Sunday service that can be used with many different devices. The "Bible Project" also includes public domain, uncopyrighted source code and data files for churches, organizations, and individuals to use in their own Bible projects for free. God is not a business and the Bible is not a product, so all this is free if you want to use it. "New Christian Bible" is undergoing a name change from "New Christian Bible" and there may be some inconsistency in names during this change. </p><a href="https://github.com/ACB-Bible/DOC">Bible Code Project Technical Documentation</a><br><br><p align="center"><em>God loves you, Jesus loves you, I love you, and this is God's free gift to you .....</em></p></div>`
