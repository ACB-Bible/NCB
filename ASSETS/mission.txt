        <p>This is My Mission:<br><br>
          My mission is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said, 'Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.' I see this mission as an important mission, because the internet is a whole new world being created by God.

          The "New Christian Bible" is part of a ministry that God has given   me. It's the computerized part of this ministry, and it includes all the source code that operates the website. It will contain many different historical versions of the Bible.
