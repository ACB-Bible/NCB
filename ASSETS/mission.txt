        <h1>New Christian Bible (NCB)</h1>
        <p>This is My Mission:<br><br>
          My mission is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said, 'Go out into all
          the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.' I see this mission as an important mission,
          because the internet is a whole new world being created by God.</p>
        <p>The <strong>New Christian Bible (NCB)</strong> is part of a ministry that God has given me. It's the
          computerized part of this ministry, and it includes all the source code that operates the <strong>NCB</strong>
          website. The <strong>NCB</strong> will contain many different historical versions of the Bible, plus a brand
          new version called the <strong>Twenty-First Century Bible (TWF)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Twenty-First Century Bible (TWF)</strong> is another part of this ministry. The
          <strong>TWF</strong> Bible is a modern, new, twenty-first century version of the Bible that's not yet
          finished, but it's currently being translated from various biblical texts. I hope you find this work to be a
          high quality and useful online Bible for your worship services, and your Biblical studies. I hope it helps you
          with your mission to preach God's word to the entire world. If anyone finds salvation through these efforts,
          no matter if it's one person or millions, then I believe I'll have accomplished the mission that God entrusted
          me with.</p>
        <p><em>God loves you, Jesus loves you, I love you, and this is God's free gift to you .....</em></p>
