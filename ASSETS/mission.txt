In Mark 1:17-18 Jesus said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.' And right away they abandoned their nets, and followed him. I do not believe that the word "net" in "internet" is a coincidence. My mission and my ministry is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said in Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:19-20, 'Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.' </p><p>I believe the internet is a whole new world being created by God. The New Christian Bible is a high tech part of that world, and a ministry that God has given me to oversee. It's one of the websites in the Bible Code Project that are a part of this ministry. It contains many different historical versions of the Bible, and all the source code and data files for this website are in the public domain. It's available free, and anyone that wants to can use any of this code or data in their own projects. </p><br><hr id="project"><br><h4>The Bible Code Project</h4><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ACB-Bible/Bible-Code/">Bible Code Project Documentation for Developers</a><br>If you'd like to try your hand at developing your own Bible website, the Bible Code Project is a collection of GitHub repositories containing source code and data that anyone can use to develop their own computerized Bible project.
