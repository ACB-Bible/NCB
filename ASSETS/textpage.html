            This is a list of movies, shows, music, and testimonials about our savior Jesus Christ that I've found to be very inspiring. The quality of these productions is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe these productions were given to us by God to use in our ministries to help teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is "The Chosen", it has presented a new perspective on Jesus that I always knew was there, but could never find the right words to convey this new outlook to others. Most of the movies, music, and shows listed here are supported by advertising, but "The Bible Project" receives no money for these recommendations, they're just things that I like.

               A hippie street preacher, an unhappy teen and a straitlaced California pastor wind up creating a new kind of church after crossing paths in the '70s.

It is however available to stream for a fee on all these services; Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Google Play Movies, Netflix, VUDU, and YouTube. I like this movie because it's the only one I've ever seen that tells the story of how I met Jesus.<br>
