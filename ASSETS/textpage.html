         <p>These are The Things I Believe<br><br>
         <p>I. I believe there is only one God, who is, was, and always will be, and I believe that God is the Holy Trinity: Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
         <p>II. I believe that Jesus said, 'If you have seen me you have seen the Father.'</p>
         <p>III. I believe that Jesus Christ was immacuately conceived by the Holy Spirit and was born to a virgin named Mary in a little town named Bethlehem.
         <p>IV. I believe that Jesus came to earth not to judge the world, but to save it.</p>
         <p>V. I believe that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>
         <p>VI. I believe that Jesus came to fulfill all things written, and the kingdom of God is at hand
         <p>VII. I believe we must repent of our sins and believe in the gospel.</p>
         <p>VIII. I believe that the Kingdom of Heaven is here, now because I have seen it.</p>
         <p>IX. I believe that Jesus Christ lived, was crucified, died, and rose again on the third day after he was entombed to save us from our sin.</p><br>
