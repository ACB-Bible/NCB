                If you've ever been involved in spreading the the Good News and teachings of Jesus Christ, then you know well the suffering your soul has had to endure from the lies and attacks thrown at you from darkness that many of his followers have suffered from the beginning. Many of God's ministries today are on the TV, internet, radio, and in many other types of electronic media. These are some of the ones that I've read, watched, or listened to over the years. They've strengthened my faith, brought new light into the darkness, and I've learned a lot from them. Every time my soul gets tired and I feel my faith dragging, I turn to one of these ministers, and they heal my spirit and give rest to my soul. I really like these ministries, and I beleive that they're truly doing God's work. Listen to them and they'll help fill you with the Holy Spirit.

                        I began watching Pastor Dr. Arnold Murray about ten years ago. I watched him for many years, and I didn't know until today that he'd passed away years before I began watching his Sunday morning services, I was sorry to hear this news because I always learned something from him when he spoke. I find his sermons to be very educational and filled with the Holy Spirit. I still enjoy watching and listening to his sermons, his message is always honest and uplifting, and I think you'll like him too.

                        Dr. Charles Stanley has been my pastor since I first discovered his ministry in the early 1980's. I was very saddened to hear of his death, he was a good shepherd, and I'm going to miss him. I've been watching his Sunday morning TV show most Sunday's since the 80's, and I still watch his rerun sermons to this day: I think you'll like him too.

                        Dr. David Jeremiah believes our dreams should be greater than our memories, and we should seize every opportunity God puts in our path, which allows us to continue growing and reach new hearts with God's Word. I've been watching Dr. Jeremiah since the 1980's, his sermons always lift my spirits, and I think you'll like him too.

                        I just recently began listening to K-Love Radio and I really enjoy it. The DJ's are bright and cheerful, and God's word comes through strong and powerfully. I listen to this broadcast every time I'm in my car going anywhere. Give it a try and maybe you'll like it too.

                        I've been watching Dr. John Ancherberg a long time, probably about since the early 1980's. John's teachings are inspirational, spirit filled, and very educational. I've learned a lot from Dr. Ancherberg, and I think you can learn a lot from him too.
