         <h4>New Christian Bible - Movies</h4>
         <hr>
         </p>
         I've found these movies about our savior Jesus Christ to be very inspiring. They are top quality productions, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe these productions are a gift from God to use in our ministries to help teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is The Chosen, it presents a new perspective of the love of Jesus that I always knew was there, but could never find the words to express. Most of the movies, music, and shows listed here are supported by advertising, but I like them anyway.
