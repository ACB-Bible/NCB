         This is My Mission<br><br>
         I do not believe that the word "net" in "internet" is a coincidence. My mission and my ministry is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said in Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:19-20, 'Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.'
      </p>
      <p>
         In Matthew 16:18 Jesus said, 'I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.' In Mark 1:17-18 Jesus said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.' And right away they abandoned their nets, and followed him.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is an important mission, because the internet is a whole new world being created by God. The "New Christian Bible" is a high tech part of that world, and a ministry that God has given me to build and oversee. It's one of the websites in the "Bible Code Project" that are a part of this ministry. It will contain many different historical versions of the Bible, and all the source code and data files for this website are in the public domain. It's available for free, and anyone that wants to can use any of this code or data in their own projects.
