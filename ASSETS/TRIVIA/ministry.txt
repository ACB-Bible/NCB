`<div id="id-ncbPage" class="cs-ncbPage"><h4 id="ncbsf">New Christian Bible - Ministries</h4><hr></p>If you've ever been involved in spreading the the Good News and teachings of Jesus Christ, then you know well the suffering your soul has had to endure from the lies and attacks from darkness his followers have suffered from the beginning. There are many of God's ministries on TV, the Internet, the Radio, and in many other types of media. These are some of the ones that I've read, watched, or listened to over the years. They've strengthened my faith, brought new light into the darkness, and I've learned a lot about love from them. Every time my soul gets tired and I feel my faith dragging, I turn to one of these ministers, and they heal my spirit and give rest to my soul. I really like these ministries, and I beleive that they're truly doing God's work. Listen to them and they'll help fill you with the Holy Spirit. </p><hr id="movies"><br><h4>Ministries</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@InTouchMinistries/playlists/">Dr. Charles Stanley • Stream</a><br>(1932 - 2023)<br>Website -•-><a class="atc" target="_blank" href="https://www.intouch.org/read/daily-devotions?ad=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-ebAgcXsgwMV1F5_AB2f9wcqEAAYASAAEgJw9vD_BwE/">InTouch Ministries</a><br>Dr. Charles Stanley has been my pastor since I first discovered his ministry in the early 1980's. I watched and still watch Dr. Stanley most Sunday mornings since then. I was very saddened to hear of Dr. Stanley's death, but I know he's in Heaven with God, and I can still see his spirit on TV every Sunday morning in shows from past sermons. I think you'll like him too. </li><br><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@YHVHSavior/playlists/">Arnold Murray • Stream</a><br>(1927 - 2014)<br>Website -•-><a class="atc" target="_blank" href="https://shepherdschapel.com/">Shepherds Chapel</a><br>I began watching Pastor Dr. Arnold Murray about ten years ago. I watched him for many years, and I didn't know until today that he'd passed away years before I began watching his Sunday morning services, I was sorry to hear this news because I always learned something from him when he spoke. I find his sermons to be very educational and filled with the Holy Spirit. I still enjoy watching and listening to his sermons, his message is always honest and uplifting, and I think you'll like him too. </li><br><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@drdavidjeremiah/playlists/">David Jeremiah • Stream</a><br>Website -•-><a class="atc" target="_blank" href="https://www.davidjeremiah.org/">Turning Point Ministries</a><br>Dr. David Jeremiah believes our dreams should be greater than our memories, and we should seize every opportunity God puts in our path, which allows us to continue growing and reach new hearts with God's Word.
