The quality of these recordings is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe this gift from God was given to us to use in our ministries, and to help teach those who hunger for God's word. Most of the music listed here is supported by advertising, but I like them anyway, I hope you like them too. </p><hr><br><h4>Music</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG0vH4WYChQ/">Amazing Grace</a><br>1970 • 4 min 43 sec • Judy Collins<br>This amazing rendition of "Amazing Grace" was recorded by Judy Collins in 1970, but the lyrics and music were written in written by John Newton in December 1772. </li><br><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srs1YoTVzs&t=184s/">Fear is a Liar</a><br>2019 • 3 min 22 sec • Zach Williams<br>Isaiah 41:10<br>God said, "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
