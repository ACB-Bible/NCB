`<div id="id-ncbPage" class="cs-ncbPage"><h4 id="ncbsf">New Christian Bible - Music</h4><hr></p>There's lots of music out there about our savior Jesus Christ, but I've found this list of my favorites to be very inspirational for me, I hope it is for you. The quality of these recordings is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe this gift from God was given to us to use in our ministries to help teach those who hunger for God's word. Most of the music listed here is supported by advertising, but "The Bible Code Project" receives no money for any these recommendations, they're just things that I like. </p><hr id="music"><br><h4>Music</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG0vH4WYChQ/">Amazing Grace</a><br>1970 • 4 min 43 sec • Judy Collins<br>This amazing rendition of "Amazing Grace" was recorded by Judy Collins in 1970, but the lyrics and music were written in written by John Newton in December 1772. </li><br><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srs1YoTVzs&t=184s/">Fear is a Liar</a><br>2019 • 3 min 22 sec • Zach Williams<br>Isaiah 41:10<br>God said, "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
