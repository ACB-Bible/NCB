`<div id="id-ncbPage" class="cs-ncbPage"><h4>New Christian Bible - Movies</h4><hr></p>I've found these movies about our savior Jesus Christ to be very inspiring. The production quality of some of these movies is better than others, but they're all inspired by the Holy Spirit. These films and videos are a gift from God for us to use in our ministries to teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is The Chosen, it presents a new perspective of the love of Jesus Christ that I always knew was there, but could never find the words to express. Most of the movies listed here are supported by advertising, but I like them anyway. </p><hr><br><h4>Movies</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsZUH6xTkaw/">2nd Greatest</a><br>2016 • 2 hr 1 min • NR • Drama<br>A pastor, a homeless drunk, and a police officer try to reunite a community and stop a rich, pompous real estate tycoon from having a low-income trailer park closed down.
