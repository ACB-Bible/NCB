`<div id="id-page" class="cs-page"><div class="cs-midPage"><h4>New Christian Bible - Movies</h4><p>I've found these movies to be very inspiring. Many of them are about our savior Jesus Christ, but some are not. The production quality of some of them is better than others, but I believe that they're all inspired by the Holy Spirit. These films and videos are a gift from God for us to use in our ministries to teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is "The Chosen", it presents a new perspective of the love of Jesus Christ that I've always known was there, but could never find the words to express. Most of the movies listed here are supported by advertising, but I like them anyway, and I hope you do too. </p><hr><br><h4>Movies</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsZUH6xTkaw/">2nd Greatest</a><br>2016 • 2 hr 1 min • NR • Drama<br>A pastor, a homeless drunk, and a police officer try to reunite a community and stop a rich, pompous real estate tycoon from having a low-income trailer park closed down.
