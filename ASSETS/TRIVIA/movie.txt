`<div id="id-ncbPage" class="cs-ncbPage"><h4 id="ncbsf">New Christian Bible - Movies</h4><hr></p>This is a list of movies, about our savior Jesus Christ that I've found to be very inspiring. The quality of these productions is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe these productions a gift from God to use in our ministries to help teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is "The Chosen", it presents a new perspective on Jesus that I always knew was there, but could never find the words to express his love to others. Most of the movies, music, and shows listed here are supported by advertising, but "The Bible Code Project" receives no money for these recommendations, they're just things that I like. </p><hr id="movies"><br><h4>Movies</h4><ol><li><a class="spa" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsZUH6xTkaw/">2nd Greatest</a><br>2016 • 2 hr 1 min • Drama<br>A pastor, a homeless drunk, and a police officer try to reunite a community and stop a rich, pompous real estate tycoon from having a low-income trailer park closed down.
