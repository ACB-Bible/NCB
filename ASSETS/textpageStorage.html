    <h4>New Christian Bible - Mission</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This is My Mission<br><br>
        I believe God wants me to tell you about the sacrifice he made to save us from our sins.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Matthew 16:18 Jesus said, 'I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.' In Mark 1:17-18 Jesus said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.' And right away they abandoned their nets, and followed him. I do not believe that the word "net" in "internet" is a coincidence. My mission and my ministry is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said in Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:19-20, 'Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.'
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe the internet is a whole new world being created by God. The New Christian Bible is a high tech part of that world, and a ministry that God has given me to oversee. It's one of the websites in the Bible Code Project that are a part of this ministry. It contains many different historical versions of the Bible, and all the source code and data files for this website are in the public domain. It's available free, and anyone that wants to can use any of this code or data in their own projects.

        <h4>New Christian Bible - Movies</h4>
        <p>
        I've found these movies to be very inspiring. Many of them are about our savior Jesus Christ, but some are not. The production quality of some of them is better than others, but I believe that they're all inspired by the Holy Spirit. These films and videos are a gift from God for us to use in our ministries to teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is "The Chosen", it presents a new perspective of the love of Jesus Christ that I've always known was there, but could never find the words to express. Most of the movies listed here are supported by advertising, but I like them anyway, and I hope you do too.

    <h4>New Christian Bible - Music</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        There's lots of music out there, but I've found this list of my favorites to be very inspirational for me, and some of it's about our savior Jesus Christ. The quality of these recordings is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe this gift from God was given to us to use in our ministries, and to help teach those who hunger for God's word. Most of the music listed here is supported by advertising, but I like them anyway, I hope you like them too.

            Although this song may not have been meant to be a Christian song about God, it sends a message to my soul from God that is loud and clear. America, "One Nation Under God," has been badly beaten by the world, but these liberal old Jesus Freak hippies have a clear message from God ... "Don't give up"<br><br>

            Matthew 7:24-27 <span class="cs-number">24</span> And, Jesus said, "<span class="cs-JQ">That's why whoever hears this message and listens to me will be like the wise man, who built his house on a rock.</span> <span class="cs-number">25</span> <span class="cs-JQ">And, because it was built on a rock, the rains will fall, the floods will come, the winds will blow and beat against the house, but it will not fall.</span> <span class="cs-number">26</span> <span class="cs-JQ">Everyone who hears what I say and does not listen, will be like the foolish man, who built his house on the sand.</span> <span class="cs-number">27</span> <span class="cs-JQ">Because the rains will fall, the floods will come, the winds will blow and beat against the house, and it will fall with a great roar.</span>"

            Jonathan Roumie the actor who portrayed Jesus Christ in The Chosen TV series and the director Dallas Jenkins relay the story of making the show, and how the Holy Spirit guided their efforts. All I can say is WOW! What an amazing and powerful testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ.

        <h4 >New Christian Bible - Ministries</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
        If you've ever been involved in spreading the the Good News and teachings of Jesus Christ, then you know well the suffering your soul has had to endure from the lies and attacks thrown at you from darkness that many of his followers have suffered from the beginning. Many of God's ministries today are on the TV, internet, radio, and in many other types of electronic media. These are some of the ones that I've read, watched, or listened to over the years. They've strengthened my faith, brought new light into the darkness, and I've learned a lot from them. Every time my soul gets tired and I feel my faith dragging, I turn to one of these ministers, and they heal my spirit and give rest to my soul. I really like these ministries, and I beleive that they're truly doing God's work. Listen to them and they'll help fill you with the Holy Spirit.

                I began watching Pastor Dr. Arnold Murray about ten years ago. I watched him for many years, and I didn't know until today that he'd passed away years before I began watching his Sunday morning services, I was sorry to hear this news because I always learned something from him when he spoke. I find his sermons to be very educational and filled with the Holy Spirit. I still enjoy watching and listening to his sermons, his message is always honest and uplifting, and I think you'll like him too.

                Dr. Charles Stanley has been my pastor since I first discovered his ministry in the early 1980's. I was very saddened to hear of his death, he was a good shepherd, and I'm going to miss him. I've been watching his Sunday morning TV show most Sunday's since the 80's, and I still watch his rerun sermons to this day: I think you'll like him too.

                Dr. David Jeremiah believes our dreams should be greater than our memories, and we should seize every opportunity God puts in our path, which allows us to continue growing and reach new hearts with God's Word. I've been watching Dr. Jeremiah since the 1980's, his sermons always lift my spirits, and I think you'll like him too.

He offers many historical oriented Biblical teachings, and I think you can learn a lot from him too.
