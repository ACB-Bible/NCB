      <h4>New Christian Bible - Mission</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
         This is My Mission<br><br>
         I do not believe that the word "net" in "internet" is a coincidence. My mission and my ministry is to reach out and preach the gospel to the whole internet because Jesus said in Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:19-20, 'Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every living creature.'
      </p>
      <p>
         In Matthew 16:18 Jesus said, 'I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.' In Mark 1:17-18 Jesus said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.' And right away they abandoned their nets, and followed him.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is an important mission, because the internet is a whole new world being created by God. The New Christian Bible is a high tech part of that world, and a ministry that God has given me to build and oversee. It's one of the websites in the Bible Code Project that are a part of this ministry. It will contain many different historical versions of the bible, and all the source code and data files for this website are in the public domain. It's available for free, and anyone that wants to can use any of this code or data in their own projects.

   <h4>New Christian Bible - Movies</h4>
   <p>
   I've found these movies about our savior Jesus Christ to be very inspiring. The production quality of some of these movies is better than others, but they're all inspired by the Holy Spirit. These films and videos are a gift from God for us to use in our ministries to teach those who hunger for God's word. My favorite is The Chosen, it presents a new perspective of the love of Jesus Christ that I always knew was there, but could never find the words to express. Most of the movies listed here are supported by advertising, but I like them anyway.

   <h4>New Christian Bible - Music</h4>
   <hr>
   <p>
      There's lots of music out there about our savior Jesus Christ, but I've found this list of my favorites to be very inspirational for me, I hope it is for you. The quality of these recordings is excellent, and I believe they're inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe this gift from God was given to us to use in our ministries, and to help teach those who hunger for God's word. Most of the music listed here is supported by advertising, but I like them anyway.

   <h4>New Christian Bible - Testimonials</h4>
   <hr>
   <p>
      These Testimonials about our savior Jesus Christ have inspired me. These people were powerfully affected by the Holy Spirit, and they tell of their experiences with the Holy Spirit as a witness to others. Most of these testimonials are supported by advertising, but they seem sincere to me, and I like them anyway.

   <h4>New Christian Bible - Ministries</h4>
   <hr>
   <p>
   If you've ever been involved in spreading the the Good News and teachings of Jesus Christ, then you know well the suffering your soul has had to endure from the lies and attacks from darkness his followers have suffered from the beginning. There are many of God's ministries on the TV, the Internet, Radio, and in many other types of media. These are some of the ones that I've read, watched, or listened to over the years. They've strengthened my faith, brought new light into the darkness, and I've learned a lot about love from them. Every time my soul gets tired and I feel my faith dragging, I turn to one of these ministers, and they heal my spirit and give rest to my soul. I really like these ministries, and I beleive that they're truly doing God's work. Listen to them and they'll help fill you with the Holy Spirit.

         Dr. Charles Stanley has been my pastor since I first discovered his ministry in the early 1980's. I watched and still watch Dr. Stanley most Sunday mornings since then.
